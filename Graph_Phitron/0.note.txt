Graph(Direction)
    - Directed
    - Undirected
Edge(Weight)
    - Weighted
    - Unweighted

Tree (Speacial Graph)
    - Only 1 Connected components 
    - No Cycle or (Number of Edges = Number of vertex - 1), 
    ( Edge = Vertex - 1)

Representation ( Graph )
    input
        7 (node)(n)
        12 (edge)(m)

    1. Adjacency Matrix
        - very dense graph
        - vector<vector<int>> adjmatrix;
        - int adjmatrix[n][n];
    2. Adjacency List
        - less edge / sparse graph
        - vector<int> adjlist[n];
    3. List of Edges

Tree is a sparse graph
e = v - 1
