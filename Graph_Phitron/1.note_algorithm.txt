DFS
    - finding connected components
BFS
    - single source shortest path
        - best on unweighted undirected, 
            - only check number of edges
        - fails on weighted undirected 
        - finding unweighted graph shortest path
Dijsktra
    - single source shortest path
        - best on weighted undirected graph
        - Naive :       bfs(Q) + path relaxation
        - Optimized :   bfs(PQ) + path relaxation
        - fails on negative weight
Bellman Ford
    - finding weighted graph shortest path
    - pass on negative weight
