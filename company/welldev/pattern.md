Singleton Design Pattern:
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. Common use cases include managing a shared resource, logging, or database connections.

Here's a basic implementation of the Singleton pattern in C++:

Factory Design Pattern:
The Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It's used when the creation of an object is complex or when the exact types of objects need to be determined at runtime.


Certainly! Here are a few more design patterns that are commonly discussed in interviews:

1. Builder Design Pattern:
The Builder pattern is used to construct complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. This pattern is especially useful when dealing with objects with many optional parameters or configurations.

2. Observer Design Pattern:
The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is commonly used in event handling systems, GUI components, and distributed systems.

3. Decorator Design Pattern:
The Decorator pattern allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It's useful for adding features to classes without modifying their structure. It is often compared to inheritance where the difference is that the Decorator pattern modifies behavior at runtime.

4. Strategy Design Pattern:
The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it. This pattern is useful when you have a family of algorithms and you want your client code to be able to choose which one to use dynamically.

5. Adapter Design Pattern:
The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects. It's useful when you have legacy code or third-party libraries that you need to integrate with your system.

6. Composite Design Pattern:
The Composite pattern composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This pattern is useful when you have to work with hierarchical data structures and want to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

7. Proxy Design Pattern:
The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It can be used to add a level of indirection when accessing an object, allowing for lazy initialization, access control, logging, or monitoring of the real object.

Understanding these patterns and being able to discuss their use cases, advantages, and implementation details can be valuable in interviews, especially for roles involving software design and architecture.
