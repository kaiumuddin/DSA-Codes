BFS
- single source sp
- Unweigted Undirected,
- Unweigted directed,
- Queue: O(v + e)

Dijktra
- single source sp
- Weigted Undirected
- Naive: Queue + path relaxation : O(v*v)
- Optimized: PQueue + path relaxation : O(v + e log V)
- fails on Negative weight

Bellman-Ford Algorithm - Edge List
- single source sp
- weighted and unweighted
- pass on negative edge weights
- The shortest path cannot be found if there exists a negative cycle in the graph
- Bellman-Ford is also capable of detecting negative cycles
- V - 1 for loop : Shortest path
- V for lopp : negative cycle detect
- O(v * e)

Floyd Warshall - adj matrix
- all pair sp
- Weigted directed, Weigted Undirected
- positive and negative edge weights
- O(V^3)
- better for Dense Graphs and not for Sparse Graphs
- does not work for the graphs with negative cycles
- has a negative cycle if the distance from a vertex to itself is negative at the end of the algorithm
