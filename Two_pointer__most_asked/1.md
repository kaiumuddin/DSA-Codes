Two-pointer techniques are commonly used in array-related interview questions to solve problems efficiently. Here are some popular interview questions that involve two-pointer techniques:

Two Sum: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. (Variations include finding all pairs that sum up to a target, finding unique pairs, etc.)

Three Sum: Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Container With Most Water: Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i are at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Trapping Rain Water: Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array: Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Move Zeroes: Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Merge Sorted Array: Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

Reverse Words in a String: Given an input string, reverse the order of the words.

Find All Duplicates in an Array: Given an array of integers, 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once. Find all the elements that appear twice in this array.

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

These are just a few examples, but there are many more interview questions that involve two-pointer techniques on arrays. Understanding how to use two pointers efficiently can help you solve a wide range of array-related problems.
