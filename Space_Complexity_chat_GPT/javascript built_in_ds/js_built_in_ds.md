JavaScript provides several built-in data structures that can be used to store and manipulate data. Here is a list of the most commonly used built-in data structures in JavaScript:

1. Arrays: Arrays are a collection of values that can be stored in a single variable. They are used to store a list of items and are indexed by number.

2. Objects: Objects are collections of key-value pairs. They are used to store information in a structured way, and can be accessed using the keys.

3. Strings: Strings are used to store a sequence of characters. They are immutable, which means that once created, their values cannot be changed.

4. Numbers: Numbers are used to represent numeric values. They can be used for mathematical operations, and come in different types, such as integers and floating-point numbers.

5. Booleans: Booleans are used to represent true or false values. They are often used in conditional statements.

6. Maps: Maps are a collection of key-value pairs that allow any value, including objects and functions, to be used as the key.

7. Sets: Sets are a collection of unique values, and can be used to eliminate duplicates in arrays.

8. WeakMaps: WeakMaps are similar to maps, but allow the garbage collector to remove keys that are no longer being used.

9. WeakSets: WeakSets are similar to sets, but also allow the garbage collector to remove values that are no longer being used.

These built-in data structures can be used in a variety of ways to store and manipulate data in JavaScript.





Here are the space and time complexity of the built-in data structures in JavaScript:

1. Arrays
- Space complexity: O(n)
- Time complexity:
  - Accessing: O(1)
  - Inserting: O(n)
  - Deleting: O(n)
  - Searching: O(n)

2. Objects
- Space complexity: O(n)
- Time complexity:
  - Accessing: O(1)
  - Inserting: O(1)
  - Deleting: O(1)
  - Searching: O(n)

3. Strings
- Space complexity: O(n)
- Time complexity:
  - Accessing: O(1)
  - Concatenation: O(n)
  - Searching: O(n)
  - Substring: O(n)

4. Numbers
- Space complexity: O(1)
- Time complexity: O(1)

5. Booleans
- Space complexity: O(1)
- Time complexity: O(1)

6. Maps
- Space complexity: O(n)
- Time complexity:
  - Accessing: O(1)
  - Inserting: O(1)
  - Deleting: O(1)
  - Searching: O(n)

7. Sets
- Space complexity: O(n)
- Time complexity:
  - Adding: O(1)
  - Deleting: O(1)
  - Searching: O(n)

8. WeakMaps
- Space complexity: O(n)
- Time complexity:
  - Accessing: O(1)
  - Inserting: O(1)
  - Deleting: O(1)

9. WeakSets
- Space complexity: O(n)
- Time complexity:
  - Adding: O(1)
  - Deleting: O(1)

It's important to note that the space and time complexity of these data structures can vary depending on the specific implementation and use case. Additionally, when working with large data sets or performance-critical applications, it's important to consider the complexity of algorithms used to operate on these data structures as well.
